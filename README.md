# HeartRateToWeb

## Introduction

This program let you use the heart sensor of your Samsung Watch to display it on software that can read file like OBS. (tutorial below + watch compatibility list below). 

This is a simple python program that react like a mini web server without the need of installing software like WAMP / LAMP or other web server like Apache / Nginix.

## How does it work ?

When you launch the file, the web server will start on your localhost and your LAN IP.

Usually for the best reaction time, you will use the LAN IP on your watch, and the localhost address on your software.

To maximise the compatibility between devices, I started the project on a web app. This is fast and a convinient way to put things in place.

## Start the program

#### Windows


On Windows you can use two easy ways.

##### CSharp

Just go to the release section, download the last zip with "csharp" in the name,
and run it as admin, you will have some IP showed up, take the appropried one,
and insert it in your watch. Click on "Start Server" and start on your watch and
you will get data into your computer.

The output file `hr.txt` is in the `www` folder where the executable is.

##### Python


Download the program in the release section, to be sure, put the program in is own folder
and double click on it, you will see your IP and Port to enter in the wearable app.

Then you can reduce it. (not close it !)

That's it.

If you have python3+ installed you can launch the program in a Powershell
by typing : 

```
PS > C:\Users\username\Downloads\heartbeat>python main.py [port]
``` 
#### Linux

You can start with : 
```
user@localhost~/Downloads/heartbeat$ python3 main.py [port]
```

#### MacOS

Sorry, I have no clue. Something similar to Linux ?

## Bugs ? How do I report one ?

For now, none. If you found one, please use the issue section.

How ? 

 - You must indicate your Platform (Windows / Linux / MacOS) and your version.
 - What you were expecting from the program ?
 - What you actually get from the program ?
 - Computers specs (CPU / RAM / Network Config)


## Compatibility

For now, I know for sure the Samsung Galaxy Watch is compatible, I own one
and it works fine.

Now for the other watches : 

 - Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 : Yes. (confirmed by others)
 - Samsung Galaxy Watch : Yes.
 - Samsung Galaxy Watch Active : Yes. (confirmed by others)
 - Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 : Yes. (confirmed by others)
 - Samsung Gear Sport : Yes. (confirmed by @ikemarx)
 - Samsung Gear S3 : Must be compatible too.
 - Samsung Gear S2 : Must be compatible too.
 - Samsung Gear S : I don't know at all.
 - Samsung Galaxy Fit(e) : Since there is no app store, no.
 - Watches before this is likely to be too old.
 
Now, watches with the Tizen Plaform version 2.3.2 and + 
is supposed to be compatible.

#### What about the Huawei Watches, Garmin, etc... ?

Well it's complicated, because I don't own thhese watches. I have no clue if you can create your own app like Samsung.

## Todo

 - Add a auto stop feature when the watch is not connected anymore.

## Releases

You can find release in the release section. There are none for now.
I will wait the watch app to be released first.

## Build an exe

For windows users you can build the script with this command

```
pyinstaller --onefile main.py --name heartbeatreceiver-build
```

Then go to the `dist` folder, and run the exe file. If you want to use the `/obs` endpoint, please make sure that the `obs.html` file are in the 
same folder, and your `js` and `css` folders too if you want to have more custom style.

### OBS

There is multiple way to use the heartbeat on OBS, you can choose to read directly from the file, from the heartbeat endpoint 
or the obs endpoint.

#### From file

On OBS, you can add a text source, be sure to select "read from a file", and select the `hr.txt` file in the same directory of your
executable. OBS will take care of refreshing the content automaticly.

#### From /hr endpoint

Only on Windows as far as I know, you can add a Browser source on your OBS, and enter the following
address : `http://localhost:6547/hr` this will output the heartrate at this time.

This is **NOT** refreshed every time.

#### From the /obs endpoint

This is why this project is made, OBS. If you have some knowledge in HTML / CSS and know where to copy/paste code, then
you will be able to make your own template.

The `/obs` endpoint output a HTML page with support of CSS and JS. 
jQuery will be used to refresh the heartrate in real time.

Add a browser source with `http://localost:6547/obs` and OBS will start to show the webpage you created.
